# iecs

[![CI](https://github.com/sestrella/iecs/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sestrella/iecs/actions/workflows/main.yml)

An interactive CLI for ECS to help with troubleshooting tasks like:

- Run remote commands on a container.
- Check the logs of a running container.

Compared to the AWS CLI, if no parameters are provided to the available
commands, the user would be requested to choose the desired resource from a
list of all tasks running on ECS.
